## Key Concepts and Techniques

### 1. **Hexadecimal Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Hexadecimal data represents the binary content of files in a human-readable format.
   - **Applications in Forensics**:
     - Identifying file types by their headers (magic numbers).
     - Searching for specific patterns or text strings within a file.
     - Verifying file integrity by analyzing metadata and checksums.
   - **Teaching Example**:
     - Convert the string `"Kayak4"` to hexadecimal:
       ```plaintext
       ASCII: K  a  y  a  k  4
       Hex:   4B 61 79 61 6B 34
       ```
     - Use these values to search for `"Kayak4"` in a disk image using HxD or WinHex.

### 2. **Data Carving and File Recovery**
   - **What is Data Carving?**
     - The process of reconstructing files from raw data by analyzing fragments and file headers.
   - **Common Challenges**:
     - Fragmentation: Files may not be stored in contiguous blocks.
     - Missing Metadata: Deleted files often lack directory entries, making recovery dependent on headers.
   - **Teaching Example**:
     - Disk Image: `InMod15New.dd`.
     - Use ProDiscover or WinHex to:
       - Extract JPEG fragments starting with the magic number `FF D8`.
       - Reassemble fragments into a complete image.
       - Verify the file by examining its metadata (e.g., creation date, file size).

### 3. **Steganography Techniques**
   - **What is Steganography?**
     - A technique for embedding hidden information within digital files, such as images or audio.
   - **Embedding Data**:
     - Use steganographic tools to hide a message (e.g., `"Confidential"`) within an image.
     - Validate the process by checking the original and modified file sizes.
   - **Detecting Hidden Data**:
     - Inspect the file structure for anomalies, such as added bytes or patterns.
     - Use forensic tools to extract and interpret embedded messages.
   - **Teaching Example**:
     - Hide the message `"SecretKey"` inside a `.png` file.
     - Detect the hidden message by analyzing residual data using WinHex.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: **Hexadecimal Analysis**
   - Open a disk image in HxD or WinHex.
   - Search for specific strings or patterns in the raw data.
   - Example Task:
     - Locate the string `"Password123"` by converting it to hexadecimal (`50 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 31 32 33`) and searching for it in a disk image.

### Step 2: **Data Carving**
   - Open the disk image `InMod15New.dd` in ProDiscover.
   - Identify file fragments based on their headers and footers (e.g., `JPEG` files start with `FF D8` and end with `FF D9`).
   - Extract and concatenate the fragments to reconstruct the full file.
   - Analyze the recovered fileâ€™s metadata for timestamps, owner information, and integrity.

### Step 3: **Steganography**
   - Embed a hidden message within an image using a steganographic tool.
   - Validate the embedding by comparing the original and modified image files.
   - Extract the hidden message using forensic tools and verify its accuracy.
