# Steganography and Digital Forensics Lab

## Overview
This project focuses on using steganography and forensic analysis tools to embed, extract, and recover hidden data within files. Through hands-on exercises, participants learn techniques such as hexadecimal analysis, data carving, and attribute interpretation using tools like HxD, ProDiscover, and WinHex.

## Key Features
1. **Hexadecimal Analysis**:
   - Use HxD to convert text strings to hexadecimal values for forensic searches.
   - Analyze hexadecimal data to identify patterns and attributes within file structures.
2. **Data Carving and Recovery**:
   - Employ ProDiscover and WinHex to extract and reassemble scattered file fragments from disk images.
   - Recover deleted or hidden files using forensic techniques.
3. **Steganography**:
   - Hide and extract messages or files within images.
   - Combine forensic tools with steganography techniques to uncover hidden data.

## Lab Steps
1. **Hexadecimal Conversion**:
   - Convert text strings (e.g., "Kayak4") into hexadecimal values using HxD.
   - Save and utilize these values for forensic searches in ProDiscover.
2. **Data Carving**:
   - Extract file fragments from disk images (`InMod15New.dd`) and concatenate them to recover full files.
   - Analyze metadata and timestamps for recovered files to verify integrity.
3. **Steganography**:
   - Embed hidden messages within images and extract them using specialized tools.
   - Inspect image files for residual data and validate results.
